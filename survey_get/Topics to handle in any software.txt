Topics to handle in anp software app :

Performance and Query Optimization

    Use indexing and efficient queries (avoid SELECT *, use LIMIT, pagination).
    Use caching (Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data.
    Optimize database schema and avoid unnecessary joins.
    Use batch processing for bulk operations.
    Profile and optimize code using tools like Django Debug Toolbar, Odoo Profiler, or SQL query analyzers.

Authorization

    Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    Use permissions at both the UI and API levels.
    Restrict data access based on user roles (e.g., only managers can approve leaves).

Authentication

    Use secure authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth2, session-based auth).
    Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) if needed.
    Use encrypted passwords (bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2).
    Handle user session management securely.

Auto Logout

    Implement session expiration and inactivity timeout.
    Provide warnings before auto logout.
    Use refresh tokens for seamless re-authentication.

Security

    Protect against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking.
    Use HTTPS and secure cookies.
    Limit login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
    Keep dependencies updated to fix vulnerabilities.

Time Zone Handling

    Store timestamps in UTC and convert them based on the user’s time zone.
    Use libraries like pytz in Python or moment.js/day.js in JavaScript for handling conversions.
    Ensure scheduled jobs run in the correct time zone.

Race Condition Issues
    use timestamps, you can implement optimistic locking. This ensures that when multiple users try to update the same record, only the first valid update succeeds, while others must reload the latest version before retrying.eg(last_upadet field and compare it with last refresh of user )


    Implement optimistic locking (e.g., versioning system where updates fail if the version number doesn’t match).
    Use database transactions where needed.
    Use WebSockets or polling to keep UI updated with the latest data.

Concurrency Handling

    Use real-time sync (WebSockets, Firebase) to update forms dynamically.
    Implement locking mechanisms (soft locks with a timeout).
    Warn users if they are working on an outdated form before submission.
    Allow merging of changes where possible instead of overwriting.


Scalability and High Availability

    Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
    Use horizontal scaling (adding more servers) or vertical scaling (upgrading resources).
    Implement database replication and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
    Consider using containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) for better scalability.

Logging and Monitoring

    Use centralized logging with tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog.
    Implement application performance monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic or Prometheus.
    Set up alerting systems for errors, crashes, and performance issues.

API Design and Optimization

    Follow RESTful or GraphQL principles for efficient API design.
    Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse.
    Use asynchronous processing (Celery, RabbitMQ) for long-running tasks.
    Optimize API responses with compression (Gzip, Brotli) and caching strategies.

Error Handling and Debugging

    Implement global error handling for backend and frontend.
    Use structured logging to capture detailed error information.
    Provide user-friendly error messages instead of generic system errors.
    Implement a fallback mechanism to handle failures gracefully.

Background Jobs and Task Scheduling

    Use Celery (Python) or RQ (Redis Queue) for handling background tasks.
    Implement scheduled jobs for periodic tasks (cron jobs, Odoo scheduled actions).
    Ensure idempotency (running a task multiple times should not cause issues).

File Handling and Storage Optimization

    Use cloud storage solutions (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for scalability.
    Optimize uploaded files with compression and format conversion.
    Implement access control for file permissions.

Data Backup and Recovery

    Set up automated backups (daily, weekly, monthly) with retention policies.
    Ensure disaster recovery plans (database snapshots, redundancy).
    Provide a rollback mechanism in case of failed migrations.

Mobile Responsiveness and PWA Support

    Ensure the app is mobile-friendly using responsive design.
    Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) features for offline access.
    Optimize loading times with lazy loading and asset optimization.

User Experience (UX) Enhancements

    Provide a dark mode and customizable themes.
    Implement auto-save functionality in forms.
    Use AI-driven recommendations (personalized content).

Accessibility and Localization

    Follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) for better accessibility.
    Implement multi-language support with localization (i18n, gettext).
    Provide text-to-speech and keyboard navigation options.
